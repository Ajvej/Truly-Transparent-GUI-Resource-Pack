# Truly-Transparent-GUI-Resource-Pack
Finally Transparent GUI Resource pack that uses minimal Outlines.

Only supported languages for white text in GUI: `English`

You can drop the whole .zip file in resourcepacks folder.

## Known Issue: #
Mojang decided to use same `.png` for `barrels/chests/enderchests`. This png is called `generic_54.png`. This creates small issue of those containers not having bottom outline as for those containers the `generic_54.png` gets cut in half. Thanks Mojang <3

Also there is 1.13 panorama which you can delete by:
1) Opening the Resource pack folder
2) Going in `assets -> minecraft -> textures -> gui`
3) Remove title folder

That way it will use different panorama if your other Resourcepacks have custom one or will use Vanilla one
